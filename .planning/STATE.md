## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Vertical MVP slices laid along the upstream dependency DAG — Phase 1 is the thinnest load→predict→verify spine; later phases widen one layer each, ending runnable + 1e-5-tested.
- [Roadmap]: HistGradientBoosting confirmed in v1 scope (Phase 4) — the most complex sklearn loader path.
- [Roadmap]: CPU cubecl backend validated to 1e-5 (Phase 6) before any GPU backend is attempted (Phase 7).

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 3] serde_json rejects NaN/Inf by default; XGBoost JSON uses them — resolve in the XGBoost loader research-phase.
- [Phase 5/6] cubecl control-flow constraints (`continue` unsupported, helpers must be `#[cube]`) and CPU-backend op gaps — spike a minimal kernel before the full port.
- [Phase 5] Golden-vector reproducibility — store actual input matrices + a toolchain/libm/framework manifest, not just seeds.
