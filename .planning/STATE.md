## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Vertical MVP slices laid along the upstream dependency DAG — Phase 1 is the thinnest load→predict→verify spine; later phases widen one layer each, ending runnable + 1e-5-tested.
- [Roadmap]: HistGradientBoosting confirmed in v1 scope (Phase 4) — the most complex sklearn loader path.
- [Roadmap]: CPU cubecl backend validated to 1e-5 (Phase 6) before any GPU backend is attempted (Phase 7).
- [01-01]: Enum variant names mirror upstream `kXxx` verbatim; `non_camel_case_types` suppressed at module level for porting fidelity.
- [01-01]: Inherent `from_str` (not `std::str::FromStr`) mirrors upstream `FromString` fallible-parse API; `clippy::should_implement_trait` suppressed.
- [01-01]: `TreeBuf<T>` is a two-mode enum `Owned(Vec<T>)`/`Borrowed{ptr,len}` with `T: Copy` POD bound; `bytemuck` deferred to Phase 9.
- [01-01]: Confirmed `num_class`/`leaf_vector_shape`/`target_id`/`class_id` are `Vec<i32>` (array-typed per tree.h:543-547), not scalars as ROADMAP wording implied.
- [Phase ?]: [01-02]: load_xgboost_json builds the F32 variant unconditionally — XGBoost-JSON only ever yields <f32,f32>.
- [Phase ?]: [01-02]: base_score margin transform stays in f64 throughout (sigmoid -ln(1/p-1)); objective.rs has zero f32 tokens.
- [Phase ?]: [01-02]: Per-tree parallel arrays validated against tree_param.num_nodes before building -> DimensionMismatch, never OOB (ERR-01).

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 3] serde_json rejects NaN/Inf by default; XGBoost JSON uses them — resolve in the XGBoost loader research-phase.
- [Phase 5/6] cubecl control-flow constraints (`continue` unsupported, helpers must be `#[cube]`) and CPU-backend op gaps — spike a minimal kernel before the full port.
- [Phase 5] Golden-vector reproducibility — store actual input matrices + a toolchain/libm/framework manifest, not just seeds.
